**Image Processing Assignment -- Master Forgery**
========================
This is an assignment from Image Processing module.


Introduction
------------------------
In a sneaky move, you have slipped in to The Boss's office and snapped a piccie of his signature ([Boss.bmp](Boss.bmp)). Full of nefarious plans to empty the company accounts, you slap it into an official document only to find very disappointing, unconvincing results ([Signature.pdf](Signature.pdf)). Use your newly acquired Image Processing prowess to clean Boss.bmp to give a more convincing and usable signature for your forged documents. 

- Make sure the system cleans the whole picture and not just the signature;

- Adaptive thresholding and segmentation masking would work well here;

- Challenge : Find, isolate and clean the signature of the idiot pictured in [Signature.pdf](Signature.pdf);

- Refer to the general guidelines to maximise your marks;

- Submit a single m-file here.
